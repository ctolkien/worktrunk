Worktrunk is a CLI for Git worktree management, designed for parallel AI agent workflows. Git worktrees give each agent an isolated branch and directory; Worktrunk adds branch-based navigation, unified status, and lifecycle hooks. The goal is to make spinning up a new AI "developer" for a task feel as routine as `git switch`.

## Getting Started

We recommend:

- **Start with Worktrunk as a simpler & better `git worktree`**: create, navigate, list, and clean up git worktrees with ease
- **Later use the more advanced features if they resonate**: [LLM commit messages](/configuration/#llm-commit-messages), [local merging with CI-like checks](/concepts/#local-merging-with-wt-merge), [fzf-like worktree picker](/commands/#wt-select), [Claude Code integration](/advanced/#claude-code-integration), and more
